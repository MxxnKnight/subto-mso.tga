# Agent Instructions for Subtitle Search Bot

> **CAUTION:** This file contains critical information for the operation and maintenance of this bot. **NEVER DELETE THIS FILE.**

## 1. Project Overview

This is a Telegram bot that scrapes movie and series subtitle information from `malayalamsubtitles.org`, stores it in a **PostgreSQL database**, and allows users to search for and download subtitle files. The project has been refactored to use a persistent database instead of JSON files to prevent data loss and service restarts.

### Core Dependencies
- `fastapi` & `uvicorn`: For the web server.
- `aiohttp`: For asynchronous HTTP requests.
- `asyncpg` & `psycopg2-binary`: For connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
- `requests` & `beautifulsoup4`: For web scraping.

## 2. Core Architecture

The project uses a decoupled architecture for stability and scalability.

-   **Web Service (Render):** The live Telegram bot is a FastAPI application defined in `app.py`. It is hosted on Render's free web service tier. Its primary role is to respond to user interactions by querying the central PostgreSQL database.

-   **Scraper (GitHub Actions):** Data collection is handled by `scraper.py`. This script is executed automatically once a day by a GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/scraper.yml`. The workflow connects to the PostgreSQL database, scrapes the latest subtitles, and directly inserts or updates records in the database. **It no longer commits any files to the repository.** This architecture prevents the bot from restarting every time the data is updated.

## 3. Key File Details & Logic

-   **`app.py`:** The main FastAPI application.
    -   **Database Connection:** On startup, `init_db` connects to the PostgreSQL database using `asyncpg` and creates the `users` and `subtitles` tables if they don't exist.
    -   **Force Subscription:** If the `FORCE_SUB_CHANNEL_ID` environment variable is set, the bot will check if a user is a member of that channel before processing their commands. If they are not a member, it will prompt them to join.
    -   **Admin Commands:** Includes commands for the `OWNER_ID`, such as `/stats`, `/delete`, `/rescrape`, and the new `/add <url>` command for scraping a single page.
    -   **Decoupled Scraper Functions:** The `/rescrape` and `/add` commands use self-contained scraping functions within `app.py` to avoid circular dependencies.

-   **`scraper.py`:** The main data scraper.
    -   **Database Logic:** The `main` function is `async` and connects to the PostgreSQL database. It uses an "UPSERT" (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`) command to add new entries and update existing ones.
    -   **No File I/O:** The script no longer reads from or writes to any JSON files.

## 4. Development & Testing

-   **Testing the Scraper:** The scraper is the most complex part. Test locally before committing changes.
    -   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    -   You must have a local PostgreSQL instance or a cloud-hosted one.
    -   Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
    -   `SCRAPER_MAX_PAGES=1 python scraper.py`
-   **Key Challenge - Scraper Fragility:** The scraper's logic is tightly coupled to the HTML structure of `malayalamsubtitles.org`. **If the website's HTML, class names, or IDs change, the scraper will break.**

## 5. Configuration

-   **`render.yaml`:**
    -   The `prebuildCommand` is used to run `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libpq-dev build-essential`. This is critical for installing the system-level dependencies required to compile the `asyncpg` Python package on Render's build servers.
-   **Environment Variables:**
    -   `DATABASE_URL`: **This is now the most critical variable.** It must be the connection string for your PostgreSQL database.
    -   `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: The secret token for your bot.
    -   `OWNER_ID`: Your personal Telegram User ID for admin commands.
    -   `LOG_GROUP_ID`: The ID of the Telegram group where feedback and logs will be sent.
    -   `FORCE_SUB_CHANNEL_ID` (Optional): If you want to force users to join a channel, set this to the channel's ID (e.g., `-100123456789`). **The bot must be an admin in this channel.**
    -   `FORCE_SUB_CHANNEL_LINK` (Optional): The public link to your channel (e.g., `https://t.me/yourchannel`), used in the "please join" message.
    -   `WEBHOOK_SECRET`: **Auto-generated by Render.**
    -   `SCRAPER_MAX_PAGES`: (For GitHub Action) Controls how many pages the scraper will process. Default is `6`.
